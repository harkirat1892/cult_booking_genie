# cult_booking_genie
A small tool to book Cult.fit classes. Isn't it a trouble to stay awake late only to book your favourite class for next morning?


Set your preferences in the `preferences.py` file.

Set preferred time you want to go for the class, and the preferred classes, priority-wise.


Your highest priority class will be attempted to be booked first, if multiple preferred classes are available for booking.

Put your cookie and center_id into the `auth.py` file


This is a `Python 3` based project. Do run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before doing anything.


Enjoy a healthy life!

PS: No harm done, no unnecessary hits to the cult.fit servers. Just trying to create a useful functionality that doesn't need me to manually go through the app every night to be able to book classes for the next day, based on what I wish to do.

Pull requests welcome, suggestions welcome! Red carpet welcome!
